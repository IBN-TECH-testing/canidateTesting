# tests
There are a few challenges to solve, some will be easy some more dificult. 
Git clone these files then use your terminal or ubuntu (or equivelent) to solve them. 
Save your solutions and upload to your own github in a new repository named "my tests". 
Upon completion you will email me your github repository link at adam@ibn-tech.com thanks and best of luck.
//Note: if you are unable to git clone or create a repository because of the computer you are taking this test on,
//then just copy paste the test questions to a text file, then complete the tests and send the text file to us at
//the above email.
